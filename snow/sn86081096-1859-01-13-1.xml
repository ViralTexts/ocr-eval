I Mr.. EDITOO.—THROUGH the columns
'ofy~ur paper i wish to state a few tacts
tor the consideration ol school directors.
Being soI.n -what interested m the progress
and welfare of common school-2, I have
tak n tii ■ liberty (or availed myself.oftho
ri h to examine .-omc of the reports oi
0 . ci er—and iu one uf the uiost liourish-
I :ng ;unl p>. pu'.ou* townships iu the eouu­
t\, L n i ced a report that had the follow­
ing recommendations:
i roui beginning to end, it bad not a
single marie of puncuation, although sev­
er..'l abbieviated words aud initials of per­
' sun ' names were its. &lt;l, thus leaving the
leader a fair chance to peruse it through
without interruption. .Neither was there
, much bother from capitals, lor about one
half the author's names began with small
jle-'ters; and the possessive case was eu­
. tireiy unknown. As to spelling, when I
! said " gramar" " mid ten' etc., L couolud­
ied the policy was to shorten words—but
1 next came " arithmoticlc' and some ro­
t ma: kably ingenious spelling of scholars'
1 names, (specimens ot which 1 ll out send
now,) words to which uiy rule would not
apply, and consequently 1 am still '• halt­
ing between two opinions," with this phi­
losophical question unsolved.
'i his, Directors, is actually true, and
1 j what I want to know is how such poorly
fjualitied teaohers happen to be employed,
j L hardly think it is the wish of our citi­
zens who pay only thirteen mills school
tax on the dollar, to have their children
instructed by persons so delicient. Is the
i i County Superintendent in fault for grant­
- ing them a certificate ? In this case Ihe
'• cert ideate" certified that the teacher ira&amp;
1 not competent to teach, and the same, 1
am confident is the case with ah those
whoso quaiint nous are so deficient tout
aspire to the pro less ion ot teaching. Aud

'1 bis is a practical question ; and I am
aware that it is a two -sided question. In
l spite of the glowing descriptions that the
• Father*" give >•' the schools they at-'
I tended, where the master jerked from two
to a dozen over the de*iv daily, and flouacd
is many more—for ail they use to be so
; very still and fearful, ami careful nut to
j touch a slate and pencil before they wore
fourteen years old. Alt ho' it was thought
necessary to read the -'code' the svuond
morning after letting the urchin* have
i their way uue day, or perhaps at noon if
they got too bad, affixing to each article
tlie dread penalty "come onto (The floor,
draw your jacket, settle the account/'
Notwithstanding all these things, there
are some teachers who cuter school now-a-.
! days v. ith tiie resolution that they will not,
I enforce the government of tiie school
1 through fear of physical suffering. They
tare willing that the scholars should know1
i that there will not be a whip brought in­
to the school house. They intend that
every one in school shah not only umler-
jstand what the regulations are, but. shad
know why they are made, and shall beal­
lowed to pass his unbiased judgment on :
their utility. There are two systems, di-j
verse from each other, each of which isi
j sanctioned by teachers of true worth and
•merit, and I may add success. I, like
I many others, as a practitioner and mi par-j
i tial observer, find myself in a dilemma.;
The baud that pens these lines has wielded
Esq. Hickory, whose recipient was the
! back of a rebel puoil. The uiotto "Do,
Right" enforced by gentle means and per­
suasiveness has also been my rule of ac­
tion. From these considerations f see
• strong reasons lor the belief, that, '1 the i
p over of corporeal punishment were tak- j
len from teachers, our schools Would bo
•be ll; d. Here is my data :
is:. K.ery child has a sense ot justice.
2nd E" -uy child whose inn.ate good-!
j rn-sv i.* oherisimu will do all he can toeu­
! force the jrincip'es of justice, whether it
' I '
; condemns or -commends sob.
3rd. The system of punishing can claim
j to do nothing more than to crush the evil:
of our nature, leaving the good alone,
while the other plan is, in its very nature
j calculated to cherish a luxuriant, growth!
| of goodness, justice aud self-govern.cent,
amidst which tne dread evils of wicked'
mortals soon vanish aud arc unknown. I
may bo wrong, but t do contend that;
. every pupil has a sens.- of right and wrong
and is a lover of justice, and that iuas­
mjcii as, physical punishment rather!
| crushes than cherishes these feelings, iu
Ishould ho iii-continued, and the teacher

; Our Present Orthography a i'ratkal
Pa Hurt . i
Did the bad effects of our orthography;
end iu being a scientific failure they
■might be borne with. But this is tar;
, from ti'ing the case. A system oi'writ­
rintr which proceeds ru- '..idingto m rule,
;ceases to be a system oi alp'abctic writ-.
. ing a'tohetl cr, the term iu its prop­
er sense), is, in fact a system by which
' each separate word has a seoarato i:ule­
, pendent evntbol, whieii nm t be indlvid­
/ uully committed to men.orv. so that the
/sound should recall the sign and the sign j
;11 • e sound, and tiie only advantage of
having these symbols composed ot por­
tions of a series of 20 known an 1 named
. forms, is the greater readiness with which
ihc eye discriminates them, and the parts
of each symbol may be described iu words.
. In poiut of fact all the ordinary systems;
.'of teaching to read and spell, proceed up­
| on this fundamental fact. One system,
/known as the "look aud say" method,
j does so without disguise; tlie teacher
.'points tea word, utters the sound, and
:; proceeds in this way with every new word
.: until the child reeeu'uues it when shown
u
' again.
[ j In other systems, the fact is more or
Jless disguised by teaching first the names
.| of the several constituent parts. But iu
all systems, the mode in which spelling
iis taught displays the principle in all it.*
i i native ugliness. Column after column of
dull symbols, have to be committed to
memory by naming the letters of which
J the words are composed, the most tedi­
] ou, uiost irksome, most irrational exer­
(ci.se of a child's memory which it is weli
.; possible to conceive.
If we then conceive spelling as a con­
jitrivau.ee. for rendering the enmmuniea­
s'ficn of ideas and their preservation easy
[land rapid, we must condemn the present
51 orthography as a prac'tcal taiiure.

'J'no.-e of our spelling are only less numer­

i thorny blindly, to sacritice aii reason, all

jas t!re English, a system which affords no
information whatever to the foreigner as
ito the sound he has to give the wuid.* in
order to be intelligible to English speak­
ers cannot but be regarded as a great iu­
' teruational failure.
Our orthography is an act ice enemy to
education.
It would be easy t'> show that our or­
; thography is an est In tic and philuiogical
failure ; that it prevents us from acquir­
ing some uniform standard of pronuncia­
tion or from learning the real changes
that have taken place in the course of j
I ag •* during the formation of our language,
that it. tnrows great hindrances in the
way of i ur study of comparative piiiiolo-:

boar to iw- ii. Tliey must occur to every
j thinking mind. They are borne out by
consll.it.experience; they are tha thing.*
i that a knit of no doubt.
But; it is necessary to recur to the edu­
c itioual c l!-ct- of our present orthogra-
Ipiiv t r they are at once the most im­
portant and th". most generally felt. The;
one e icat p . ;ut is, thai with our &lt;prcr&lt;nt,
tj 'ay ii is a rery i'/ny and thpicult |
proe,.-. to learn to read, and a stili long­
ler and more diyieult prur si f.i learn to
icrite. Tito e msequeucc is that children'
are forced to waste years over acquiring
the power to use the mere tools where-j
!w ihal to &lt;lig out knowledge. N'uw a­
; though it by no means follows that those
who can read and write, aye, read and
write with the greatest ease and eorrect­
ucss, are in any respect educated, yet it
'tis quite certain that, those who cau no/a
j read aud write with some degree of facil­
; ity are almost entirely uniustructed. The'
i system of instruction at our schools does'
■ j nut admit of education being conducted
; without reading and writing.
In tills country whore every child en­
joys the opportui ity of instruction in the,
common schools', the rime which is stilk
■ wasted over the necessary preliminary or
(learning to read, detracts much lrotn the
(education given, because it deprives thei
(teacher of the opportunity to give that
other instruction aud that other training|
■ which constitutes real education, while'
• the very circumstance of having to teach !
: a subject of the nature of our orthography,
(gives the child a false training, a bend iu
1! the wrong direetiou, a something to un­
learn iu liis very first learning. Thcpro­
(cess of instruction iu reading is therefore
' I not merely no assistance Io other teaching,'
but absolutely a detriment. Our orthog­
■ raphv is therefore an incubus which all I

L c
cent uumber of Mohammed Pacha's Let­
ters to the Suit in from New York, which
*OIXO3 satirist is supplying to the N . \. &lt;
Keening Poet: ]
MRS. GRUNDY.
And in the domain of politics Mrs. G.
is watchfully potent. When that im­
i practicable and terrible abstract young
man, L. J. Brutus Smith, began to utter
| his unwise Phillipics against the baseness,
! fraud and injustice which seemed to him |
'to he dominant in the fvleral goverrmient
of the United States, the old lady, who
was at that time iu business in South
street, assailed Brutus through the \ i■-
and from the rostrum. She thought he
was attacking the Capitol, and, Ji::e her
prototypes, she began to cackle an anserine
alarm : " (), Brutu*, vou wretched young
dreamer, you icotiucia.it, you enthusiast,
! how dare you shake the pillars iu the
Temple of Liberty?" You are a smart
young chap, and I like to have you make
! sport for me, but don't play Sampson aud
pull dowu the edifice about my ears. I Lav
(dare you stir up sectional strife, and
I threaten the ruin of these states, when
I \'ou know perfectly well that the Union
jis a beautiful balance between duty and ;
i expediency, expressly constructcd to weigh
(out the profits of my trade, and that if
I you carry out your absurd schemes for
Alio advancement of right, as you call it,
my notes will go to pro!est in thirty days.,
j And when the abstract Brutus denies
, tlx-.G be has any desire to dissolve the
Union, and cooly asserts that the Union
i was instituted for the fostering of good,
instead of the perpetuation of evil; that
the constitution was framed, a* its writers
declare, for the promotion of justme, an !
! not as a cunningly devised bargain with
' evil; that wrong, though it date its dyna ty
from the death of- Abel, can never hive
the authority of precedent; that it is far1
' better that the nation, being an aggregate
! of individuals, should be frugal, and bon­
iest, and religious, rather than rich, dis-;
hone.*t and cruel, with much else of the
i same sort, Mrs. G. ceases to cackle and
i commences to hi**. oih uius ! O Smith i
|you are a traitor, an infidel, an atheist, a
pool ; you must not teach my sous, dance,
at my balls, marry my daught"i\s, lecture
; in my lyceums, sit in my legislative halls
,—out with you, you bold, bad man!"
. And a large number of other old ladies b •-
iiievc t these charges, and approved of this
sentence ; and so the enthusiastic B/uttis
Urn ith had to comfort hinisolf as b(-*i lie
: may. Do you think, my lowly Ben ilas­
>san, that it was difficult fur him to com-!
;fort himseif under the circumstances ?
But Airs. Grundy is particularly inter­
jested in the riatrimouial affairs of young
1 people. In this sphere she generaliy aw
sumes the t/niirine -ex, an ! plays her
i part with feminine skill an 1 persistence. '
j You must know, my dear Ah d, that :n (ae
western continent a man takes but on
wife (of his own) at a tint*?; and that tire!
i selecti m of this one is. evHen !y, a mat-1
iter of more moment than in our beloved
I Turkey. A young man. tiierefore, is not'
considered capable of making fc r hi:us If1
' *o important, a choice; for if lie should
] blond; r, the consequences to society w.iu'id
;be n rviffic. IT ncc, when the audabie!
jand ingenuous Lorenzo arrive* at years;
ofdiscrction, society calls u Tea-Table Oon-:
vefftion, and appoints Airs. Grundy a com­
mittee of one, with full power, to arrange
his affairs. She accepts the trust with
alacrity. She takes her place in the best:
; pew in the church, and from her command­
ing position t>he observes that the eyes of
' Lorenzo occasionally wander towards the
' slip occupied by the lovely and accuin-,
; pushed Jessica. She notes the fact that
j Lorenzo joins Jessica at the church door,
and talks in his usual devoted style aboul
the sevmon and the weather. M rs. Grun­
dy smiles complacently, and makes her:
first report to Lac Teu-tubie Convention,;
■ briefly thus :
i " Your committee respectfully beg*'
leave to report as follows :
"Lorenzo is very attentive to Jessica—."
A\ liicli report is adopted, nem. con.
Mrs. G. then goes to the Philharmonic,;
and observes the fact that Lorenzo, quite
! oblivious of Beethoven op.. GOO, converses
with Jessica in a delicious undertone.
She thereupon makes her second report
to the T. 'J'. Convention :
" Your committee would respectfully
reports as follows :
" Lorenzo is over head and ears in love
' with Jessica." Adopted unanimously.
The venerable lady next meets Loren/.r
near Union square, and walks with him
]as far as Twenty-third street, (he in­
i forms him, to his great surprise, that be

BEAUTIFUL SNOW.

Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow,
Filling the sky and the earth below ;
Over the house-tops, over the street,
Over the heads ot the people you meet ;
Dancing,
Flirting,
Skimming along.
Beautiful snow! it can do nothing wrong ;
Flying to kiss a fair lady's cheek :
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,
Beautiful snow, from the heavens above,
Pure as an angel and fickle as love!
Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow !
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go !
Whirling about in its maddening fun,
It plays in its glee with every one,
Chasing,
Laughing,
Hurrying by,
It lights up the face and it sparkles the eye ;
And even the dogs with a bark and a bound,
Snap at the crystals that eddy around.
The town is alive and its heart in a glow,
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow.
How the wild crowd goes swaying along,
Hailing each other with humor and song ;
How the gay sledges like meteors flash by—
Bright for a moment, then lost to the eye,
Ringing.
Swinging,
Dashing they go.
Over the crest of the beautiful snow,
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,
To be trampled in mud bv the crowd rushing
by ;
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands
of feet
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible
street.
Once I was pure as the snow—but I fell ;
Fell, like the snow-flakes, from heaven—to
hell!
Fell, to be trampled as the filth of the street ;
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat,
Pleading,
Cursing,
Dreading to die
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,
Hating the living and fearing the dead.
Merciful God! have I fallen so low?
And yet I was once like this beautiful snow !
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,
With an eye like its crystals, a heart like its
glow ;
Once I was loved for my innocent grace—
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face,
Father,
Mother,
Sisters all,
God and myself, I have lost by my fall.
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by
Will take a wide swoep, lest I wander too nigh,
For of all that is on or about me, I know,
There is nothing that's pure but the beautiful
snow.
How strange it should be that this beautiful
snow
Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go !
How strange it would be, when the night
comes again,
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate
brain !
Fainting,
Freezing,
Dying alone !
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan
To be heard in the crash of the crazy town,
Gone mad in their joy at the snow's coming
down ;
To lie and to die in my terrible wo,
With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow!

To School Directors.
Mr. EDITOR.—Through the columns
of your paper I wish to state a few facts
for the consideration of school directors.
Being somewhat interested in the progress
and welfare of common schools, I have
taken the liberty (or availed myself of the
right) to examine some of the reports of
teachers—and in one of the most flourish­
ing populous townships iu the coun­
ty, i noticed a report that had the follow­
ing recommendations:
From beginning to end, it had not a
single mark of puncuation, although sev­
eral abbreviated words aud initials of per­
sons' names were used, thus leaving the
reader a fair chance to peruse it through
without interruption. Neither was there
much bother from capitals, for about one
half the author's names began with small
letters; and the possessive case was en­
tirely unknown. As to spelling, when I
said "gramar" "midlen" &amp;c., I conclud­
ed the policy was to shorten words—but
next came "arithmatick" and some re­
markably ingenious spelling of scholars'
names, (specimens of which I'll not send
now,) words to which my rule would not
apply, and consequently I am still "halt­
ing between two opinions," with this phi­
losophical question unsolved.
This, Directors, is actually true, and
what I want to know is how such poorly
qualified teachers happen to be employed,
I hardly think it is the wish of our citi­
zens who pay only thirteen mills school
tax on the dollar, to have their children
instructed by persons so deficient. Is the
County Superintendent in fault for grant­
ing them a certificate ? In this case the
"certficate" certified that the teacher was
not competent to teach, and the same, I
am confident is the case with all those
whose qualifications are so deficient that
aspire to the profession of teaching. And


COUDERSPORT, POTTER COUNTY, PA., THURSDAY, JANUARY 13, 1859.


this report is not, in all respects a "rare
case," although I have seen some of a
very different stamp—and again I leave
the matter unsolved, stiil wondering "who
is to blame." X.

For the Potter Journal.
Is it Best to Punish Pupils?
This is a practical question ; and I am
aware that it is a two-sided question. In
spite of the glowing descriptions that the
"Fathers" give of the schools they at­
tended, where the master jerked from two
to a dozen over the desk daily, and flogged
as many more—for all they use to be so
very still and fearful, and careful not to
touch a slate and pencil before they were
fourteen years old. Altho' it was thought
necessary to read the "code" the second
morning after letting the urchins have
their way one day, or perhaps at noon if
they got too bad, affixing to each article
the dread penalty "come onto the floor,
draw your jacket, settle the account."
Notwithstanding all these things, there
are some teachers who enter school now-a-
days with the resolution that they will not
enforce the government of the school
through fear of physical suffering. They
are willing that the scholars should know
that there will not be a whip brought in­
to the school house. They intend that
every one in school shall not only under-
stand what the regulations are, but shall
know why they are made, and shall be al­
lowed to pass his unbiased judgment on
their utility. There are two systems, di­
verse from each other, each of which is
sanctioned by teachers of true worth and
merit, and I may add success. I, like
many others, as a practitioner and impar­
tial observer, find myself in a dilemma.
The hand that pens these lines has wielded
Esq. Hickory, whose recipient was the
back of a rebel pupil. The motto "Do
Right" enforced by gentle means and per­
suasiveness has also been my rule of ac­
tion. From these considerations I see
strong reasons for the belief, that, if the
power of corporeal punishment were tak­
en from teachers, our schools would be
benefited. Here is my data :
1st. Every child has a sense ot justice.
2nd. Every child whose inmate good­
ness is cherished will do all he can to en­
force the principles of justice, whether it

condemns or commends self.
3rd. The system of punishing can claim
to do nothing more than to crush the evil
of our nature, leaving the good alone,
while the other plan is, in its very nature
calculated to cherish a luxuriant, growth
of goodness, justice aud self-government,
amidst which the dread evils of wicked
mortals soon vanish and are unknown. I
may be wrong, but I do contend that
every pupil has a sense of right and wrong
and is a lover of justice, and that inas­
much as physical punishment rather
crushes than cherishes these feelings, it
should be discontinued, and the teacher
should appeal to the highest and noblest
thoughts of his pupils, depending upon
these virtues and their cultivation for the
government of his school.
Fellow teacher am I not right? W.

Our Present Orthography a Practical
Failure.
Did the bad effects of our orthography
end in being a scientific failure they
might be borne with. But this is far
from being the case. A system of writ­
ting which proceeds according to no rule,
ceases to be a system of alphabetic writ­
ing altohether, (using the term in its prop­
er sense), is, in fact a system by which
each separate word has a separate inde­
pendent symbol, which must be individ­
ually committed to memory, so that the
sound should recall the sign and the sign
the sound, and the only advantage of
having these symbols composed of por­
tions of a series of 26 known and named
forms, is the greater readiness with which
the eye discriminates them, and the parts
of each symbol may be described in words.
In poiut of fact all the ordinary systems
of teaching to read and spell, proceed up­
on this fundamental fact. One system,
known as the "look and say" method,
does so without disguise; the teacher
points to a word, utters the sound, and
proceeds in this way with every new word
until the child recognizes it when shown

again.
In other systems, the fact is more or
less disguised by teaching first the names
of the several constituent parts. But in
all systems, the mode in which spelling
is taught displays the principle in all its
native ugliness. Column after column of
dull symbols, have to be committed to
memory by naming the letters of which
the words are composed, the most tedi­
ous, most irksome, most irrational exer­
cise of a child's memory which it is well
possible to conceive.
If we then conceive spelling as a con­
trivance for rendering the communica­
tion of ideas and their preservation easy
and rapid, we must condemn the present
orthography as a practical failure.
Our present orthography is a moral failure.
But there is a higher sense still in


which our spelling is a failure. To give
mankind the benefit of past ages, which
mainly distinguishes him from the brute,
it is necessary that one of the first things
a child is taught, when he is educated,
should be the art of reading, to be close­
ly followed by that of writing. He has
to learn how to receive and to communi­
cate. Nearly the first thing, then, on
which his mind is exercised under the
present circumstances, is to commit to
memory the strange and confused system
of spelling which disgraces our language.
He is therefore practically taught to re­
gard the subjects on which he is exer­
cised as subordinate to no rule. The
meaning of law, or the constant relations
of phenomena as respects similarity and
succession, is not only withheld from him,
but is rendered almost absurd.
Who would teach the idea of physical
law from the changes of the weather?—
Those of our spelling are only less numer­
ous because the number of our words are
limited The child learns, therefore, prac­
tically, in its first lessons, to yield to au­
thority blindly, to sacrifice all reason, all
common sense, all knowledge, at the
shrine of custom and routine,—to take
his master's word and ask no questions.
The mind is cramped, confined, sent back
into its polyph cell, instead of evoked.—
A great moral and logical injury is done
to the child's mind, which it requires
many years of other education, years of
instruction in physical knowledge to erad­
icate, if indeed it ever be eradicated.—
Hence viewed in connection with educa­
tion our spelling is a great moral failure.
PHONO.
NO. 5.
Our present Orthography an Interna­
tional failure.
But its faults do not end with the na­
tion that uses it. It spreads to other na­
tions. A great commercial people like
the Anglo-Saxon race, which holds Brit­
ain and the United States, must be con­
stantly brought, into connection with oth­
er nations. It becomes of the utmost
social and international importance that
they should understand each other's lan­
guage. This can generally be effected,

only through writing. A system of spell­
ing, then, which is so difficult to acquire
as the English, a system which affords no
information whatever to the foreigner as
to the sound he has to give the words in
order to be intelligible to English speak­
ers cannot but be regarded as a great in­
ternational failure.
Our orthography is an active enemy to
education.
It would be easy to show that our or­
thography is an esthetic and philological
failure ; that it prevents us from acquir­
ing some uniform standard of pronuncia­
tion or from learning the real changes
that have taken place in the course of
ages during the formation of our language,
that it throws great hindrances in the
way of our study of comparative philolo­
gy and the acquisition of foreign lan­
guages for the sake of practical intercom­
munication ; but on these matters we for­
bear to dwell. They must occur to every
thinking mind. They are borne out by
constant experience; they are the things
that admit of no doubt.
But it is necessary to recur to the edu­
cational effects of our present orthogra­
phy for they are at once the most im­
portant and the most generally felt. The
one great point is, that with our present
spelling it is a very long and difficult
process to learn to read, and a still long­
er and more difficult process to learn to
write. The consequence is that children
are forced to waste years over acquiring
the power to use the mere tools where­
withal to dig out knowledge. Now al­
though it by no means follows that those
who can read and write, aye, read and
write with the greatest ease and correct­
ness, are in any respect educated, yet it
tis quite certain that, those who can not
read aud write with some degree of facil­
ity are almost entirely uninstructed. The
system of instruction at our schools does
not admit of education being conducted
without reading and writing.
In this country where every child en­
joys the opportunity of instruction in the
common schools, the time which is still
wasted over the necessary preliminary of
learning to read, detracts much from the
education given, because it deprives the
teacher of the opportunity to give that
other instruction and that other training
which constitutes real education, while
the very circumstance of having to teach
a subject of the nature of our orthography,
gives the child a false training, a bend in
the wrong direction, a something to un­
learn in his very first learning. The pro­
cess of instruction in reading is therefore
not merely no assistance to other teaching,
but absolutely a detriment. Our orthog­
raphy is therefore an incubus which all
educators must be desirous of discarding ;
not merely a passive obstacle to be over­
come, but an active enemy which is per­
petually leading the pupil into false paths.
The reader may possibly think that we
have held up the subject in a rather un­

favorable light, and exaggerated it some­
what. But all we ask is a careful and
impartial examination of the subject and
we will leave the conclusion to him who
examines. In our next we will attempt
to show the remedy for this deplorable
state of things. PHONO.
For the Ladies.
[ We extract the following from a re­

cent number of Mohammed Pacha's Let­
ters to the Sultan from New York, which
some satirist is supplying to the N . Y.
Evening Post: ]
MRS. GRUNDY.
And in the domain of politics Mrs. G.
is watchfully potent. When that im­
practicable and terrible abstract young
man, L. J. Brutus Smith, began to utter
his unwise Phillipics against the baseness,
fraud and injustice which seemed to him
to be dominant in the federal government
of the United States, the old lady, who
was at that time in business in South
street, assailed Brutus through the press
and from the rostrum. She thought he
was attacking the Capitol, and, like her
prototypes, she began to cackle an anserine
alarm : "O, Brutus, you wretched young
dreamer, you iconoclast, you enthusiast,
how dare you shake the pillars in the
Temple of Liberty?" You are a smart
young chap, and I like to have you make
sport for me, but don't play Sampson and
pull down the edifice about my ears. How
dare you stir up sectional strife, and
threaten the ruin of these states, when
you know perfectly well that the Union
is a beautiful balance between duty and
expediency, expressly constructcd to weigh
out the profits of my trade, and that if
you carry out your absurd schemes for
the advancement of right, as you call it,
my notes will go to protest in thirty days.
And when the abstract Brutus denies
that he has any desire to dissolve the
Union, and cooly asserts that the Union
was instituted for the fostering of good,
instead of the perpetuation of evil; that
the constitution was framed, as its writers
declare, for the promotion of justice, and
not as a cunningly devised bargain with
evil; that wrong, though it date its dynasty
from the death of Abel, can never have
the authority of precedent; that it is far
better that the nation, being an aggregate
of individuals, should be frugal, and hon­
est, and religious, rather than rich, dis­
honest and cruel, with much else of the
same sort, Mrs. G. ceases to cackle and
commences to hiss. O Brutus ! O Smith !
you are a traitor, an infidel, an atheist, a
poet ; you must not teach my sons, dance
at my balls, marry my daughters, lecture
in my lyceums, sit in my legislative halls
—out with you, you bold, bad man!"
And a large number of other old ladies be­
lieved these charges, and approved of this
sentence ; and so the enthusiastic Brutus
Smith had to comfort himself as best he
may. Do you think, my lovely Ben Has­
san, that it was difficult for him to com­
fort himself under the circumstances ?
But Mrs. Grundy is particularly inter­
ested in the matrimonial affairs of young
people. In this sphere she generally as­
sumes the feminine sex, and plays her
part with feminine skill and persistence.
You must know, my dear Abel, that in the
western continent a man takes but one
wife (of his own) at a time; and that the
selection of this one is, evidently, a mat­
ter of more moment than in our beloved
Turkey. A young man, therefore, is not
considered capable of making for himself
so important a choice; for if he should
blunder, the consequences to society would
be terriffic. Hence, when the amiable
and ingenuous Lorenzo arrives at years
of discretion, society calls a Tea-Table Con­
vention, and appoints Mrs. Grundy a com­
mittee of one, with full power, to arrange
his affairs. She accepts the trust with
alacrity. She takes her place in the best
pew in the church, and from her command­
ing position she observes that the eyes of
Lorenzo occasionally wander towards the
slip occupied by the lovely and accom­
plished Jessica. She notes the fact that
Lorenzo joins Jessica at the church door,
and talks in his usual devoted style about
the sermon and the weather. Mrs. Grun­
dy smiles complacently, and makes her
first report to the Tea-table Convention,
briefly thus :
"Your committee respectfully begs
leave to report as follows :
"Lorenzo is very attentive to Jessica—."
Which report is adopted, nem. con.
Mrs. G. then goes to the Philharmonic,
and observes the fact that Lorenzo, quite
oblivious of Beethoven op., 690, converses
with Jessica in a delicious undertone.
She thereupon makes her second report
to the T. T. Convention :
"Your committee would respectfully
reports as follows :
"Lorenzo is over head and ears in love
with Jessica." Adopted unanimously.
The venerable lady next meets Lorenzo
near Union square, and walks with him
as far as Twenty-third street. She in­
forms him, to his great surprise, that he
is engaged to the fair Jessica. She con­

gratulates him. He mildly disclaims the
honor, and relates the trite story of the
Barmecide, who made a large fortune by
minding his own business. But the ru­
mor rather flatters him. He says to him­
self, "Lorenzo, my boy, it may be that
you have fascinated the fair Jessica. She
is a charming young lady, and you, my
dear fellow, are a sadly attractive dog."
Then Mrs. Grundy meets Jessica at the
grand ball of the Ipecacs, and tells her
that she (Jessica) entertains feelings of
the. most tender character towards Loren­
zo. Jessica is considerably annoyed at
this, and mentally accuses Lorenzo of
great impertinence in spreading such a
rumor. Her woman's pride (which our
prophet wisely calls the Devil) is roused.
Next time she meets him she is conscious
and embarassed, and the foolish Lorenzo
attributes her behaviour to a passion for

Mrs. Grundy. He builds a huge palace
in the clouds, in which he is to be Sultan,
and Jessie.i sole Sultana. Like a great,
vain, fnl fellow that he is\ he dreams

Mrs. Grundy is a ully old liar. Mean­
time that interesting female makes her
third report to the T. T. Convention.
" Vour committee would report as fol­
lows, and won id ask to be di.-eharged :
" Ijor. uzo has been rejected by Jessica.

propriety of discouraging his visits to the
daughters of the convention.''

Oil, amiable and in-othcr-respccts-miffi­

the gossip of Mrs. Grundy, rather than
your own heart and the laws of Jessica's
womanly nature i And O Jessica, inv

self to be piijuod by the interference of
Grundy, and so nip the budding regard
you had for Lorenz , which might have
grown into something large, leafy and
