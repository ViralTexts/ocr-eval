    <fixed>of the
defenders. The Racoon, Thrush
and Sparrow kept up the bombard­
ment until 9:50 when the palace was
tumbling in ruins and large rents
had been made in the barricade of
Said's followers, who answered the
fire of the warships with great per­
sistency and gallantry and did not
stop firing, until in response to the
flagship's signal of "cease firing"
the guns of the warships stopped
showering shot and shell ashore.
The losses of the enemy are not
known, but must have been heavy,
especially among the defenders of
the palace proper. During the bom­
bardment the sultan's armed steamer
Glasgow opened fire on the British
warships. A few well aimed shells
from the heavy guns of the Raccoon
and a shot or two from the four-inch

guns of the Sparrow crushed through
and through her, silencing her in
short order. Ultimately she sunk at
her moorings. Soon after the palace
caught fire and the walls and roof
were sent flying here and there by
the shells. Said Khalid and Said
Sales, commander of the usurping
sultan's army, escaped with some of
their followers through the back part
of the palace and hurried to the Ger­
man consulate, where protection was
accorded them.
Admiral Rawson, in order to pre­
vent the escape of Said Khallid and
his followers to the mainland of
Africa, where their presence would
undoubtedly caused trouble with the
slave dealers and their adherents,
sent detachments of marines, blue­
jackets and local Zanzibars to occupy
all the roads and avenues of escape,
hemming in the enemy pretty effec­
tively, although many escaped to the
mainland and island in dhows.
As the dispatch is sent, firing is
still proceeding in the outskirts of
this place, but all resistance has
ceased.
