qualified endorsement. These skillfull and
eminent physicians having been spoken of
in terms of high laudation by the press in
the west and east, and holding an enviable
place in the popular mind as medical refor-
mers, we felt justified in giving them a place
in our columns, which public benefactors and
popular favorites are entitled to, and the fol-
lowing letters addressed to us fully justify the
position taken.
THE following certificates are only a few of
the many patients of the Indian Herb Doc-
tors improving and cured. It would be im-
possible for us to publish, or to attempt to
publish them all. We now have patients
from all parts of the country; from West
Alexander, Washington, Steubenville, St.
Clairsville, Martinsville, Bellaire, Bridgeport,
Fulton, Triadelphia, etc.
Messers. Editors: A few weeks ago two gen-
tlemen were announced in the Wheeling pa-
pers as celebrated physicians from abroad
just arrived. Early in the spring our daugh-
ter, a younglady, was attacked by dropsy
and the dropsical elargement increasing to
such an extent, and the experience of my wife
before me, who died of the same disease, I
became alarmed.
Hearing of the Indian Herb Doctors,
I called to see them and placed her un-
der their treatment. Their medicine reduced
the dropsical effusion speedily, and she is
now nearly well of that disease. She was
also attacked by qoincy, being subject to it
from a child, and the enlargement in her
throat prevented her from swallowing,
threatening suffocation; but their medicine
caused the abscess in 24 hours to discharge a
core half as larze as a hen egg, with large
quantities of blood and matter; while at pre-
vious times she was compelled to suffer two
or three weeks waiting for the abcess to break.
The medicine used in these two diseases,
(diseases the doctors here don't pretend they
can cure,) were tbe roots of two simple plants
which grow on my farm, and which I dug
with my own hands.
Wohlland Worley,
Farm on the National Pike, in Ohio, three
miles from Wheeling, July 12, 1866.
Editors of the Intelligencer: With feelings of
real gratitude and with a view that others
may be benefited by it, I desire you to pub-
lish the following facts: For six years one of
my daughters, a young lady, has been a
wretched sufferer, never having seen a well
day during the whole time, afflicted with
dysmenorrhea, loss of appetite, aversion to
food and all the unnappy symptoms follow-
ing that disease. She has been obliged to take
Chloroform or morphine and sleep through
the unbearable suffering and pain of her
menstrual periods, and always looked to the
return of her changes with dread and horror.
She began taking medicine from Doctors
George and Pinsley June 18, in two weeks
her menstruations returned and she said she
was astonished, she passed through them
without pain or the least bad feeling. Her
appetite has returned with all its youthful
vigor; her face is assuming a healthy color;
her bad symptoms have all left her and she
now feels, acts and looks like a new person, is
entirely well after four weeks treatment.
Mrs. John Fee,
Wheeling, West Va., July 12, 1866.
P.S.—Also a younger daughter, a young la-
dy, afflicted with Erysipelas in one of her
feet for seven months, resulting in a large
running ulcer, with pain and suffering be-
yond description, unable to wear a shoe dur-
ing the whole time. The Indian Herb Doc-
tors, George and Pinsley cured her in two
weeks, so that in the third week she went to
a fourth of July dance.
If the Doctors do as well for others as they
have for my family, Wheeling will have good
reason to invoke on them the blessings of
Heaven. Mrs. John Fee.
Wheeling, July 1, 1866.
Messers. Editors: Nearly a year ago I was
prostrated by typhoid fever, having previ-
ously a strong, vigorous constitution. I was
treated with calomel and other melats, after
a long struggle the fever left me a wreck;
Amenorrhea without intermission, a severe
cough, palpatation of the heart, pain in the
side, loss of appetite, gradual wasting of my
whole muscular and nervous system, and
finally Erysipelas and swelling of the feet. I
began to look not far distant for a premature
grave when I heard the Indian Herb Doctors
had arrived in Wheeling, I went immediate-
ly to see them. They agreed to cure me, and
if they failed it should cost me nothing. I
took medicine from them, and in one week
after which the Erysipelas left me and has
not appeared since, all my bad symptoms are
rapidly passing away, my general health
is improving so that I now ride out horse
back daily. I feel that the Indian Herb Doc-
tors were sent to me as angels of mercy.
Miss Margaret A. Hall,
Proctor, Weitzel county, W. Va., June 28, '66.
This is to certify that I have been afflicted
for several years with Dyspepsia and general
debility, unable to work for months at a time.
Have paid out large sums of money to doc-
tors to little purpose, found no relief until I
applied to the Indian Herb Doctors, when I
began to improve soon after taking their
medicine and I now feel well once again.

Shipright, Wheeling, W. Va., July 12, '66.

QUACKERY.
THE ONLY PLACE WHERE A CURE CAN
BE OBTAINED.
DR. JOHNSON has discovered the most Cer-
tain, Speedy, and only Effectual Remedy
in the World for Weakness of the Back or
Limbs, Strictures, Affection of the Kidneys
and Bladder, Involuntary Discharges, Impo-
tency, General Debility, Nervousness, Dys-
pesia, Languor, Low Spirits, Confusion of
Ideas, Palpitation of the Heart, Timidity,
Trembling, Dimness of Sight, or Giddiness,
Disease of the Head, Throat, Nose, or Skin,
Affections of the Liver, Lungs, Stomach, or
Bowels—Terrible Disorder arising from
Solitary Habits of Youth—secret and solitary
practices more fatal to their victims than the
song of Syrens to the Mariners of Ulysses,
blighting their most brilliant hopes or antici-
pations, rendering marriage, &c., impossible.
YOUNG MEN
Especially, who have become the victims of
Solitary Vice, that dreadful and destructive
habit which annually sweeps to an untimely
grave thousands of Young Men of the most
excellent talents and brilliant intellect, who
might otherwise have entranced listening
Senates with the thunders of eloquence, or
waked to ecstacy the living lyre, may call
with full confidence.
MARRIAGE.
Married Persons, or Young Men contempla-
ting marraige, being aware of Physical Weak-
ness, Organic Debility, Deformities, speedily
cured.
He who places himself under the care of Dr.
J. may religiously confide in his honor as a
gentleman, and confidently rely upon his
skill as a physician.
ORGANIC WEAKNESS
Immediately cured and full vigor restored.
This distressing affection, which renders
life miserable and marriage impossible, is the
penalty paid by the victims of improper in-
dulgencies. Young persons are too apt to
commit excesses from not being aware of the
dreadful consequences that may ensue. Now,
who that understands the subject will pre-
tend to deny that the power of procreation is
lost sooner by those falling into improper
habits than by the prudent? Besides being
deprived of the pleasure of healthy offspring,
the most serious and destructive symptoms of
both body and mind arise. The System be-
comes deranged, the Physical and Mental
Functions Weakened, Loss of Procreative
Power, Nervous Irritability, Dyspesia, Palpi-
tation of the Heart, Indigestion, Constitution-
al Debility, and Wasting of the Frame, Cough,
Consumption, Decay and Death.
DR. JOHNSON,
Member of the Royal College of Surgeons,
London, Graduate of one of the most eminent
Colleges in the United States, and the greater
part of whose life has been spent in the hos-
pitals of London, Paris, Philadelphia, and
elsewhere, has effected some of the most as-
tonishing cures that were ever known, many
troubled with ringing in the head and ears
when asleep, great nervousness, being alarmed
at sudden sounds, bashfulness, with frequent
blushing, attended sometimes with derange-
ment of mind, were cured immediately.
TAKE PARTICULAR NOTICE.
Dr. J. addresses all those who have injured
themselves by improper indulgence and soli-
tary habits, which ruin both body and mind,
unfitting them for either business, study, so-
ciety, or marriage.
These are some of the sad and melancholy
effects produced by early habits of youth, viz:
Weakness of the Back and Limbs, Pains in
the Head, Dimness of Sight, Loss of Muscular
Power, Palpatation of the Heart, Dyspepsia,
Nervous Irritability, Derangement of the Di-
gestive Functions, General Debility, Symp-
toms of Consumption, &c.
Mentally.—The fearful effects on the min
are much to be dreaded. Loss of Memory,
Confusion of Ideas, Depression of Spirits,
Evil Forebodings, Aversion to Society, Self
Distrust, Love of Solitude, Timidity, &c., are
some of the evils produced.
Thousands of persons of all ages can now
judge what is the cause of their declining
health, losing their vigor, becoming weak,
pale, nervous and emaciated, having a singu-
lar appearance about the eyes, Cough, and
Symptoms of Consumption.
YOUNG MEN
Who have injured themselves by a certain
practice, indulged in when alone, a habit fre-
quently learned from evil companions, or at
school, the effects of which are nightly felt,
even when asleep, and, if not cured, renders
marriage impossible, and destroys both mind
and body, should apply immediately.
What a pity that a young man, the hope of
his country, the pride of his parents, should be
snatched from all prospects and enjoyments
of life by the consequence of deviating from
the path of nature, and indulging in a certain
secret habit. Such persons must, before con-
templating
MARRIAGE,
Reflect that a sound mind and body are th
most necessary requisites to promote connu
bial happiness. Indeed, without these th
journey through life becomes a weary pilgrim-
age; the prospect hourly darkens to the view
the mind becomes shadowed with despair an
filled with the melancholy reflection that th
happiness of another becomes blighted with
our own.

Bowels—those Terrible Disorders arising from
Solitary Habits of Youth—secret and solitary
practices more fatal to their victims than the
song of Syrens to the Mariners of Ulysses,
blighting their most brilliant hopes or antici-
pations, rendering marriage, &c., impossible.
YOUNG MEN
Especially, who have become the victims of
Solitary Vice, that dreadful and destructive
habit which annually sweeps to an untimely
grave thousands of Young Men of the most
excellent talents and brilliant intellect, who
might otherwise have entranced listening
Senates with the thunders of eloquence, or
waked to ecstacy the living lyre, may call
with full confidence.
MARRIAGE.
Married Persons or Young Men contempla-
ting marraige, being aware of Physical Weak-
ness, Organic Debility, Deformities, speedily
cured.
He who places himself under the care of Dr.
J. may religiously confide in his honor as a
gentleman, and confidently rely upon his
skill on a physician.
ORGANIC WEAKNESS
Immediately cured and full vigor restored.
This distressing affection, which renders
life miserable and marriage impossible, is the
penalty paid by the victims of improper in-
dulgencies. Young persons are too apt to
commit excesses from not being aware of the
dreadful consequences that may ensue. Now,
who that understands the subject will pre-
tend to deny that the power of procreation is
lost sooner by those falling into improper
habits than by the prudent? Besides being
deprived of the pleasure of healthy offspring,
the most serious and destructive symptoms of
both body and mind arise. The System be-
comes deranged, the Physical and Mental
Functions Weakened, Loss of Procreative
Power, Nervous Irritability, Dyspesia, Palpi-
tation of the Heart, Indigestion, Constitution-
al Debility, and Wasting of the Frame, Cough,
Consumption, Decay and Death.
DR. JOHNSON,
Member of the Royal College of Surgeons,
London, Graduate of one of the most eminent
Colleges in the United States, and the greater
part of whose life has been spent in the hos-
pitals of London, Paris, Philadelphia, and
elsewhere, has effected some of the most as-
tonishing cures that were ever known, many
troubled with ringing in the head and ears
when asleep, great nervousness, being alarmed
at sudden sounds, bashfulness, with frequent
blushing, attended sometimes with derange-
ment of mind, were cured immediately.
TAKE PARTICULAR NOTICE.
Dr. J. addresses all those who have injured
themselves by improper indulgence and soli-
tary habits, which ruin both body and mind,
unfitting them for either business, study, so-
ciety, or marriage.
These are some of the sad and melancholy
effects produced by early habits of youth, viz:
Weakness of the Back and Limbs, Pains in
the Head, Dimness of Sight, Loss of Muscular
Power, Palpatation of the Heart, Dyspepsia,
Nervous Irritability, Derangement of the Di-
gestive Functions, General Debility, Symp-
toms of Consumption, &c.
Mentally.—The fearful effects on the min
are much to be dreaded. Loss of Memory,
Confusion of Ideas, Depression of Spirits,
Evil Forebodings, Aversion to Society, Self
Distrust, Love of Solitude, Timidity, &c., are
some of the evils produced.
Thousands of persons of all ages can now
judge what is the cause of their declining
health, losing their vigor, becoming weak,
pale, nervous and emaciated, having a singu-
lar appearance about the eyes, Cough, and
Symptoms of Consumption.
YOUNG MEN
Who have injured themselves by a certain
practice, indulged in when alone, a habit fre-
quently learned from evil companions, or at
school, the effects of which are nightly felt,
even when asleep, and, if not cured, renders
marriage impossible, and destroys both mind
and body, should apply immediately.
What a pity that a young man, the hope of
his country, the pride of his parents, should be
snatched from all prospects and enjoyments
of life by the consequence of deviating from
the path of nature, and indulging in a certain
secret habit. Such persons must, before con-
templating
MARRIAGE,
Reflect that a sound mind and body are th
most necessary requisites to promote connu
bial happiness. Indeed, without these th
journey through life becomes a weary pilgrim-
age; the prospect hourly darkens to the view
the mind becomes shadowed with despair an
filled with the melancholy reflection that th
happiness of another becomes blighted with
our own.
